### Purpose: 
The purpose of our final project is to analyze the encryption and decryption techniques of different methods. These techniques include: Caesar Cipher, Base64, and Atbash. The program allows the user to choose a method and be given the result of the encryption/decryption.

### How to use:
1. Run the final_ciphers.c file.
2. Upon the start of the program, enter a character to represent the type of method you wish to use.
3. Enter a character corresponding to an encryption or decryption option.
4. Enter a string to encrypt/decrypt.
5. View results of the algorithm.
6. Restart if needed or exit the program.
